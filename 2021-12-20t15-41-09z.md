In [syntactic parsing](./2021-12-19t16-26-08z.md), a constituent is a phrase
whose components form a coherent unit. Examples of can be "noun phrases" (NP),
phrases that act as nouns, or "verb phrases" (VP), phrases that act as verbs.

This is similar to [POS tagging](./2021-12-20t12-16-56z.md), except now we have
phrasal categories or constituents rather than POS. Phrases from the same
phrasal category (e.g. NP) are said to be substitutable.
