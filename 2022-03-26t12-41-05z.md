In [information retrieval](./2022-03-26t12-31-28z.md), the inverted index is a data-structure
consisting in a hash-map which maps each term in our document collection a set
of data for each of the documents in which the term appears. The data to which
each term is mapped consists in "inverted lists", listing for example

- the ids of the document where the term occurs
- the positions at which the term occurs in each document

For example, a snippet of an inverted index showing the entry for the word
"example".

```JSON
{
  "example": {
    "doc_ids": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "positions": [{ "0": [1] }, { "2": [6, 90] }, { "5": [1] }, { "6": [6, 8] }]
  }
}
```

Only information that describes terms and documents in relation to one another
should go in the inverted index.

The inverted index can then be used to retrieve relevant documents for a query
based on the terms composing the query.
