In [probability theory](./2021-09-09t11-36-51z.md), a Markov Chain is a model
concerned with probabilities of _sequences_ of random variables known as
"states", each of which can take values from a set (such as a set of words in
the context of [NLP](./2021-12-20t10-52-27z.md)).

The defining characteristic of a Markov chain is the Markov assumption: when
predicting the future of a sequence, only the current state matters; past states
can be ignored.

$$
P(q_i = a | q_1, \dots, q_{i-1}) = P(q_i = a | q_{i-1})
$$
