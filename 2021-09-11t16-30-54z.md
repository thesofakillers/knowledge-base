[MLE](./2021-09-11t15-54-04z.md) can lead to imperfections in the estimated
parameters, with some of these differing by some factor, their _bias_, from the
true parameters describing the real underlying distribution.

This is because MLE is a _joint_ maximization, which means the maximization of
the likelihood with respect one parameter can depend on the maximization of the
likelihood of other parameters and so forth.

If each of these parameters are estimated as sample parameters (which is the
case), then an imperfect view of the dataset will be captured at each step,
leading to our bias term.

In principle, the fewer the parameters and the more the samples $N$, the lower
the resulting bias.
