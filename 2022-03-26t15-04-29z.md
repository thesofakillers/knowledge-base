In [information retrieval](./2022-03-26t12-31-28z.md), the problem is no longer
about regression or classification. We now deal with matching a query from an
infinitely large set of possible queries to a small (ranked) subset of relevant
documents from an infinitely large set of relevant and irrelevant documents.

These notions of relevance, ranking and an expectation of good few-shot
performance separate information retrieval from regression, and as such we need
to make use of different forms of evaluation.

There are various approaches for evaluating IR systems:

- [Offline Evaluation](./2022-03-26t15-44-21z.md)
- more to come
