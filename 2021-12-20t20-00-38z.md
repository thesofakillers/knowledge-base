- **similar syntactic structures may have different meanings**. This means that
  it is non-trivial for semantic models to derive meaning explicitly from
  surface-level analysis of the components when faced with certain syntactic
  structures such as the one in the example.
  - e.g.: "it snows": makes use of a pleonastic pronoun, a redundant pronoun (in
    this case "it") that is non-referential, i.e. not referring to a
    pre-established noun. We say that "it" is semantically empty, i.e. is
    missing its referent
    - not all cases of the "it [conjugated verb]" syntactic structure will have
      this same meaning. For instance we may have "it roars", where in this case
      the "it" has a particular semantic referent, a noun previously defined in
      the text (e.g. an animal).
- **different syntactic structures can have the same meaning**
- **not all phrases are interpreted compositionally**: By definition, an idiom's
  meaning cannot be derived from its components, so compositional semantic
  models will have difficulty interpreting them. Since authors can be cheeky,
  and can decide to use idioms literally (perhaps for a humorous effect), idioms
  cannot be entirely blocked/skipped by compositional semantics models,
  rendering dealing with them even more difficult
- **logical metonymy**, where additional meaning arises through composition
  - "enjoy the book" vs "enjoy the cigarette", imply different events
- **metaphor**: will default to literal interpretation
  - "inject life" vs "inject hydrogen"
