A context-free grammar (CFG) is a [formal grammar](./2021-12-20t15-48-02z.md)
whose production rules can be applied regardless of the context of a given
[nonterminal symbol](./2021-12-20t15-57-20z.md). To define a CFG we need 4
components:

1. A set of nonterminal symbols
2. A set of terminal symbols
3. A set of production rules, where the LHS is a single nonterminal and the RHS
   is a sequence of one or more nonterminal and/or terminal symbols
4. A start symbol that is nonterminal.
