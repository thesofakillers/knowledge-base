Exploring starts is a method for addressing the
[exploration-exploitation dilemma](./2022-10-20t15-59-00z.md), particularly in
[MC methods](./2022-10-22t10-38-24z.md) when estimating
[action values](./2022-10-21t11-09-20z.md).

In exploring starts, we assume that every [episode](./2022-10-21t11-26-04z.md)
starts in a state-action pair and that every state-action pair has a non-zero
probability of being selected as the starting state-action pair.
