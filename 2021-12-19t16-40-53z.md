There are various theories for approaching
[lexical semantics](./2021-12-20t10-50-39z.md)

- **Formal Semantics**: Here we represent words as sets. We can then apply logic
  to infer meanings.
  - this is quite a limited approach:
    - need to enumerate features of each word, which is extremely laborious
    - quite inflexible, and lexical semantics typically require flexibility.
- **Prototype Theory**: Here we consider graded semantic categories with no
  clear boundaries. A category is defined by a "prototype", and new members are
  added based on the resemblance to the prototype. See
  [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory)
- **Taxonomical Semantics**: Based on how the meanings of words relate to one
  another
  - hyponymy: is-a relationships
  - meronomy: part-of relationships
  - synonymy: same-as relationships
  - antonymy: opposite-of relationships
  - homonymy and regular polysemy: same word, no-relation
- [**Distributional Semantics**](./2021-12-19t16-47-22z.md): deserves a note of
  its own
