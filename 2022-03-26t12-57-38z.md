There are various ways to construct an
[inverted index](./2022-03-26t12-41-05z.md)

- naively: we simply go through each word in each document one by one
  - this is single-threaded, so can be slow for large collections.
  - this is all done in-memory, so can run into issues for large collections.
- [two-pass](./2022-03-26t14-28-42z.md)
- [one-pass](./2022-03-26t14-49-29z.md)
- distributed indexing: using
  [MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) to parallelize the
  mapping from terms to documents
