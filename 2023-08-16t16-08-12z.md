Spurious [correlations](./2020-09-28t14-34-27z.md) during training can lead to 4
possible scenarios, 3 of which are special cases of
[Causal Confusion](2023-07-10t15-30-22z.md). In particular:

1. Ideal: P(X) -> X, P(Y) -> Y
2. Causal Confusion: P(X) -> Y, P(Y) -> X
3. Causal Confusion: P(X) -> Y, P(Y) -> Y
4. Causal Confusion: P(X) -> X, P(Y) -> X
