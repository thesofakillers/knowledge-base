In [RL](./2022-10-20t15-15-55z.md), we make a distinction between _episodic_ and
_continuing_ tasks. The former are tasks with a well defined ending, a _terminal
state_. The latter instead are tasks with no well defined ending.

Episodic tasks can be trivially broken down into _episodes_, while this is
non-trivial for continuous tasks.
