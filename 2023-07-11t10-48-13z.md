During training of [GCBC](./2023-07-11t10-17-09z.md), we log a number of
metrics. For training we use visual trajectory representations and for
validation we use textual trajectory representations.

- Loss: ([DLML](https://www.giuliostarace.com/posts/dlml-tutorial))
- Action Similarity: The cosine similarity between predicted and gold actions
- Action Distance: The L1 distance between predicted and gold actions
- Gripper Accuracy: The final dimension of the action vector is discrete (1 or
  0, open or close), so we compute the accuracy of this term

Below are the curves for the first ~20 hours of training. One epoch takes
roughly 4 hours, and we validate twice per epoch.
