One approach to the [explore / exploit dilemma](./2022-10-20t15-59-00z.md) is
using $\epsilon$-greedy [policies](./2022-10-21t10-19-39z.md). Here, we act
greedily _most_ of the time, as we now have some probability $\epsilon$ of
choosing some random action from our available actions (Note that we could by
chance pick the greedy action here).

$\epsilon$-greedy policies guarantee that every action will be sampled an
infinite number of times as the number of steps approaches infinity. This
ensures their convergence to their true [value](./2022-10-21t10-45-34z.md),
while obtaining decent performance.
