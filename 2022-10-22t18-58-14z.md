In [Expected SARSA](./2022-10-22t18-03-29z.md), there is no need to use
[importance sampling](./2022-10-22t13-16-08z.md) because the expectation is
computed under the target policy and therefore does not need to be corrected.
The behaviour policy is simply used sample where to update, but not to calculate
the actual expectation in the target. As such, no correction is needed.
