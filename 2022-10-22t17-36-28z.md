To be able to implement computationally efficient versions of
[RL](./2022-10-20t15-15-55z.md) algorithms, we make use of _incremental_
updates, where we are able to update our values iteratively by changing
previously computed values.

In general, the formula looks like

$$
NewEstimate \leftarrow OldEstimate + StepSize \left[Target - OldEstimate\right]
$$

The target is generally what we use to estimate the quantity of interest. For
example, in [Monte Carlo](./2022-10-22t10-38-24z.md) methods, the target is the
[return](./2022-10-21t11-04-35z.md).

We then refer to $\left[Target - OldEstimate\right]$ as the _error_.
