When training [GCBC](2023-07-11t10-17-09z.md) on [[CALVIN]], the length of the
episodes shown ranges between 28 and 32 time-steps roughly.

When [evaluating GCBC](2023-07-11t10-52-26z.md), however, we let the policy
interact with the environment for a maximum of 240 steps without any internal
state refresh.

Because of the distribution of the training data, we hypothesize that
performance severely suffers for rollouts where the policy does not solve the
task at hand within the first 32 steps.

A fairer evaluation should essentially "reset" the model every 32 steps,
updating the trajectory embedding and the internal state, to closer match what
the model was trained on.
