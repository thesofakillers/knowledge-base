_SARSA_ is a [temporal difference](./2022-10-22t10-55-03z.md) control algorithm
which modifies [TD(0)](./2022-10-22t17-47-51z.md) by moving from state-action
pair to state-action pair rather than from state to state. In other words, SARSA
considers [action values](./2022-10-21t11-09-20z.md) instead of
[state values](./2022-10-21t10-45-34z.md), resulting in the following update:

$$
Q(S_t, A_t) \leftarrow Q(S_t, A_t) + \alpha
          \left[R_{t+1} + \gamma Q(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}) - Q(S_t, A_t)\right].
$$

SARSA converges to the best exploring policy.
