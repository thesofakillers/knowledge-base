A given 2D point or vector $\mathbf{x} = (x, y)$ in Cartesian coordinates can be
expressed in _homogeneous coordinates_ as

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{x}}
  = (\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}, \tilde{w})
  = \tilde{w}(\tilde{x}, \tilde{y}, 1)
  = \tilde{w} \bar{\mathbf{x}},
$$

where $\bar{\mathbf{x}}$ is known as the _augmented vector_.

This system treats vectors that only differ by scaling as equivalent. As such,
homogeneous coordinates are said to be invariant to scaling.
