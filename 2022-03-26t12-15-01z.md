The static web can be viewed as a directed graph, with html web pages as the
nodes and hyperlinks defining directed edges between pages. The graph is not
_strongly connected_, as an edge (hyperlink) in one direction does not imply an
edge (hyperlink) in the opposite direction. Thus each node is said to have
_in-links_, hyperlinks leading to the page, and _out-links_, hyperlinks leading
from the page to other pages.

Of course, any set of interconnected documents (not just the world wide web) can
be viewed in this way -- even this knowledge base! In fact, this forms part of
the basic implementation of the [zettelkasten](./2020-08-24t15-19-14z.md).
