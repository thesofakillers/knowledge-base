Having [fully trained](./2023-07-12t13-47-41z.md)
[CCLIPT](./2023-07-11t11-38-00z.md), and seeing promising results from
[GCBC evaluations with preliminary versions of CCLIPT](./2023-07-11t11-38-00z.md),
we now re-train and re-evaluate [GCBC](./2023-07-11t10-17-09z.md) with this
CCLIPT backend.

We imagine that this will help with overall performance, but will not
necessarily address the
[suggestive start states problem](./2023-07-11t12-12-49z.md)

Below we find the evaluation results with suggestive start states:

<!-- TODO -->

![gcbc_cclipt_sug_start](./images/gcbc_cclipt_full_sug_start.png)

And without suggestive start states

<!-- TODO -->

![gcbc cclipt non sug start](./images/gcbc_cclipt_full_non_sug_start.png)
