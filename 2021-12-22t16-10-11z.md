As the name implies, Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) are a class of
[GANs](./2021-12-22t11-42-44z.md) which make use of deep
[convolutional](./2021-12-21t22-19-52z.md) layers for in the Generator and
Discriminator to [better handle images](./2021-12-21t22-14-36z.md). We note that
the layers in the generator are transposed convolutions or deconvolutions.

[Batch normalization](./2021-12-21t19-33-00z.md) is of great importance in this
class of models to stabilize the learning process.
