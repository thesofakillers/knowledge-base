[Amortized Variational Inference](./2021-12-22t19-08-10z.md) and
[Variational Inference](./2021-12-22t18-12-57z.md) in general are not perfect.

The quality is generally determined by two factors:

- the **variational posterior**: the capacity of the variational distribution to
  model the true posterior.
  - We refer to the resulting gap between variational and true posterior as the
    _approximation gap_.
- **amortized inference**: the capacity of the amortization function to produce
  good variational parameters across the entire dataset. This is typically the
  dominating source of sub-optimality.
  - We refer to the resulting gap between amortized and non-amortized
    variational posteriors as the _amortization gap_
