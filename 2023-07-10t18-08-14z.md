title: Another approach to my thesis that we did not pursue

For my [thesis](./2023-07-10t14-32-02z.md), we briefly considered using
[[diffusion]] models to generate goal state images from our natural language
task description/instruction on which to condition our policy. This would allow
for "checking" what the policy would pursue, before allowing it to act in the
environment.

We ultimately did not pursue this approach as

- it was too difficult to control the diffusion outputs
- diffusion inference is slow
- even with perfect control, the outputs were unsatisfactory.

You can see some experimentation for this in
[diffusion-poc.ipynb](https://github.com/thesofakillers/thesis/blob/main/notebooks/diffusion-poc.ipynb)

We ultimately settled on [this method](./2023-07-10t15-06-42z.md) instead.
