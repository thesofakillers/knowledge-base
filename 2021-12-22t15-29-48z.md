CycleGANs are a class of [GANs](./2021-12-22t11-42-44z.md) designed to address
the task of Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation, where given an input image in
one domain, we wish to translate it to another domain (for instance, paintings
to images).

CycleGANs address this by training two generators and two descriptors. One
generator takes images from domain one and generates them into domain two. The
other generator does the opposite. The discriminators are then used as usual to
determine how plausible the images are.

CycleGANs then implement an additional extension wherein the output of one
generator is fed as input to the other generator, with the aim of having the
resulting final output match the original input. This cyclical interaction
(called cycle consistency) is what give CycleGANs their name.
