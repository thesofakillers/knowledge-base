One way of identifying [discourse](./2021-12-19t17-46-44z.md) is by noticing
that the nearby sentences and clauses in the candidate discourse are related to
one another in systematic ways. These systematic ways are known as coherence
relations, also known as rhetorical relations.

In general, we identify rhetorical relations between two spans of text. One is
generally labeled as the nucleus, and the other a satellite. The nucleus is more
central to the discourse's purpose and is interpretable independently; the
satellite on the other hand is less central and generally only interpretable
using the context provided by the nucleus.

There are a large variety of rhetorical relations, and the task of identifying a
rhetorical relation between two sentences is an open problem.

In the NLP1 2021 course at the University of Amsterdam, we focused on the
following four rhetorical relations:

- **Elaboration**: the satellite gives additional information or detail about
  the situation presented in the nucleus.
- **Explanation**: The nucleus is an action carried out by an animate agent and
  the satellite is the reason for the nucleus.
  - e.g.: Max fell because John pushed him
- **Narration**: The nucleus and the satellite have equal weight.
  - e.g.: Max fell and Kim kept running.
- **Justification**: The satellite gives additional information or detail about
  the situation presented in the nucleus. The information is presented with the
  goal of convince the reader to accept the information presented in the
  nucleus.
  - as-such discourse
