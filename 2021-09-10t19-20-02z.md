When introduced, [random variables](./2021-09-09t11-46-21z.md) are typically
referred to as being discrete. We may however have cases in which our random
variables are continuous.

In such cases, when considering the probabilities of these variables, we reason
in terms of _probability densities_. This is the probability that a continuous
variable $x$ will lie in an interval $(a, b)$ and is expressed with an integral:

$$
p(x \in (a,b)) = \int_a^b p(x)dx.
$$

Any probability density must satisfy two conditions:

$$
\begin{align}
                          p(x) &\geq 0    \tag{1}\\
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x)dx &= 1.      \tag{2}
\end{align}
$$

We now therefore reason in terms of probability _distributions_.

The [sum](./2021-09-10t17-07-49z.md) and [product](./2021-09-10t17-47-05z.md)
rules of probability still apply (although the former with the use of an
integral rather than a summation), as well
[Bayes' theorem](./2021-09-10t18-29-28z.md).
