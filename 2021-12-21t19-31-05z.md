[Neural Networks](./2021-04-26t18-14-48z.md) are typically limited to the data
they are exposed to during training. The more varied the dataset, the better
(more general) the model.

Often the raw dataset is limited and not enough for the model to generalize well
for the necessary test cases. Sometimes however the raw data can undergo some
simple transformations to generate new, more varied samples for the model to
train on. This process is known as data augmentation.

A simple example of a data augmentation technique is horizontally flipping
images for the recognition for horizontally symmetric objects (like most animals
for instance).

Because it helps the model generalize, data augmentation is viewed as a
[regularization](./2021-12-21t18-46-39z.md) technique.
