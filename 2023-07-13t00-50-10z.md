Since in [CLIPT](.2023-07-10t16-36-37z.md) we keep CLIP frozen and only
fine-tune the MLP heads, we can pre-compute the CLIP embeddings for the input
images and text once, and read those directly in successive runs, avoiding
having to even run any forward through CLIP itself.

This drastically speeds things up.
