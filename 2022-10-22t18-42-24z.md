_Q-learning_ is a [temporal difference](./2022-10-22t10-55-03z.md) is a special
case of the [expected SARSA](./2022-10-22t18-16-54z.md) control algorithm which
uses the greedy policy as its target policy. Essentially, instead of taking the
expectation of the next [action value](./2022-10-21t11-09-20z.md), we take the
maximum. This results in the following update:

$$
Q(S_t, A_t) \leftarrow Q(S_t, A_t) + \alpha
          \left[R_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a} Q(S_{t+1}, a) - Q(S_t, A_t)\right].
$$

Q-learning converges to the [optimal policy](./2022-10-21t12-52-19z.md).
