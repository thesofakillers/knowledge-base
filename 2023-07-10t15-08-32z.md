We can think of three ways of addressing
[goal misgeneralization](./2023-07-10t14-38-57z.md). These are generally all
addressing [causal confusion](./2023-07-10t15-30-22z.md)

1. Performing interventions on the data, to better discover the underlying
   [[causal model]].
2. Increasing the variety of the training data, to reduce the chance of spurious
   correlations.
3. Improving task specification, to eliminate and reduce ambiguity.
