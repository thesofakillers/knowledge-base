Since [distributional semantics](./2021-12-19t16-47-22z.md) treats word meanings
as vectors, this allows us to compute similarity between words using vector
operations, such as for instance euclidean distance.

A very common metric for similarity is Cosine Similarity. Mathematically, the
cosine similarity between two vectors $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}$ is given by

$$
\text{cosine}(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}) =
\frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}}{|\mathbf{v}||\mathbf{w}|}
$$
