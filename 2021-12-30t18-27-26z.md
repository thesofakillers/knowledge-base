In [deep learning](./2021-04-26t18-14-48z.md), particularly in the context of
[convolutional neural networks](./2021-12-21t22-19-52z.md), a pooling function
is one that takes some input and outputs a "summarized" representation, with
each element in the output containing a summary statistic of a corresponding
neighbourhood in the input.

Example summary statistics used are $max$, $average$ or $L^2$ norm of a given
size neighbourhood.

Pooling typically helps the learned representation to be
[_invariant_](./2021-12-30t18-44-23z.md) to small translations of the input.

This can be a useful property when we are more concerned about _whether_ some
feature is present rather than exactly how and where it is.
