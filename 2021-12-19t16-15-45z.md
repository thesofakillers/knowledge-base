In [NLP](./2021-12-20t10-52-27z.md), lemmatization is the process of mapping a
given word to its "canonical" form, i.e. from [stem + affix(es)] to [stem]. In
lemmatization, the approach is to make use of a vocabulary in combination with
morphological analysis so to return the correct lemma of the word.

An example of stemming would be mapping "dogs" to "dog".

For a quick review on stems and affixes, see
