In [RL](./2022-10-20t15-15-55z.md), the _value_ of a state is the total amount
of reward the agent can expect to receive over the future, starting from that
state.

This can be expressed mathematically, in terms of the _value function_ for a
given state, which defines the value as the
[expectation](./2021-09-11t12-11-20z.md) of the
[return](./2022-10-21t11-04-35z.md) from that particular state:

$$
v_\pi(s) \dot{=} \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ G_t | S_t = s\right].
$$

The concept can very easily be extended to
[action-value functions](./2022-10-21t11-09-20z.md).
