Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the area of
[Machine Learning](./2021-09-09t10-48-40z.md) that studies ways to develop
agents capable of sequentially interacting with an environment so to maximize
some long-term objective.

In doing so, RL hopes to understand and automate goal-directed learning and
decision making.
