We evaluate [GCBC](./2023-07-11t10-17-09z.md) across the 34 tasks of the
[[CALVIN]] environment with the provided oracle that, for a given task, can
determine whether the task has been completed given start and current state.

We evaluate using the following pseudocode, keeping track of success rate
throughout.

```python
for task in TASKS:
  task_oracle = TaskOracle(task)
  successes = np.zeros(num_rollouts)
  for r in range(num_rollouts):
    # can either be visual or textual
    goal = get_goal(task, r)
    curr_obs = env.reset()
    first_obs = curr_obs
    for _s in range(num_steps):
      action = model.step(curr_obs, goal)
      curr_obs = env.step(action)
      success = task_oracle(first_obs, curr_obs)
      if success:
        successes[r] = 1
        break
```

Essentially we interact with the environment until the goal is achieved or until
we run out of interaction steps. We specify the goal visually and textually and
compare performance.
