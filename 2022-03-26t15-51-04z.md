A test collection is a collection of the items necessary for performing
[offline IR evaluation](./2022-03-26t15-44-21z.md). In particular, it is made of

- **Test Queries**: for example collected from a query log
- **Test Documents**: representative of the application we are building
- **Ground Truth relevance scores**: for as many query-document pairs as
  possible. [How do we get these?](./2022-03-26t16-08-35z.md)
