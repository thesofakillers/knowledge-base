In [RL](./2022-10-20t15-15-55z.md), a policy $\pi$ is a function mapping the
current [state](./2022-10-21t10-20-25z.md) $s$ to an action $a$.

The policy can either be stochastic, where we output the probability of choosing
a particular action $\pi(a | s)$ or deterministic, where when in a given state,
we will always output the same action $\pi(s)$.
