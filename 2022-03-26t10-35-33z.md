In [linguistics](./2021-12-20t10-50-39z.md), Heaps' Law is an empirical formula
that describes the amount of unique words $u$ in a corpus of a given size $n$:

$$
u = Kn^\Beta,
$$

where $K$ and $\Beta$ are free, empirically determined parameters. In English,
they tend to be between 10 and 100 and 0.4 and 0.6 respectively.
