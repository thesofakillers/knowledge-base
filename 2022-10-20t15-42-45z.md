In this note:

- SL = Supervised Learning
- RL = [Reinforcement Learning](./2022-10-20t15-15-55z.md)

Here are some differences between the two fields:

- In SL, we are learning to predict, while in RL, we are learning to do.
- In SL, we have golden labels for our dataset provided by humans. This is
  rarely the case in RL.
  - the feedback received in SL is instructive: it gives the correct answer
  - the feedback received in RL is evaluative: it only evaluates how good the
    output was
- In SL, the observed data doesn't depend on what is learned. In RL, the data
  observed data can often depend on the learned strategy.
- In SL, the observed data are typically [i.i.d](./2021-09-11t13-58-06z.md). In
  RL, the data are sequential, like in [time series](./2020-09-23t15-18-55z.md)

Note: worth mentioning [[Imitation Learning]] and [[Offline RL]].
