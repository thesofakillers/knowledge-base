title: Suggestive start states in GCBC Evaluation

When inspecting the videos produced during
[GCBC evaluation](./2023-07-11t10-52-26z.md), we notice that the start states
are often very suggestive of the goal. For example, in the following video, for
the task "open the drawer", the starting state consists in the robotic arm
grasping a closed drawer.

Concerned that performance may therefore be in part due to start state
memorization, we perform evaluation again with random start-states and obtain
the following results:

|       | Textual Success Rate | Visual Success Rate |
| ----- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| count | 34.000000            | 34.000000           |
| mean  | 0.082647             | 0.188529            |
| std   | 0.168024             | 0.232628            |
| min   | 0.000000             | 0.000000            |
| 25%   | 0.000000             | 0.010000            |
| 50%   | 0.010000             | 0.085000            |
| 75%   | 0.097500             | 0.287500            |
| max   | 0.710000             | 0.740000            |

We see a drastic decrease in performance, indicating that the policy was indeed
heavily relying on starting states.

We consider two possible not mutually exclusive explanations, which we
investigate in the presented order:

1. CCLIPT is ignoring the second half of the input to its trajectory encoders,
   since the first half is the same for both.
2. The policy is memorizing the starting states.
