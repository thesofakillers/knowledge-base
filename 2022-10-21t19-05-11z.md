[Policy iteration](./2022-10-21t18-51-34z.md) and
[value iteration](./2022-10-21t18-56-54z.md) are special cases of a more general
concept known as _generalised policy iteration (GPI)_. This is the idea the
continous interaction between the [policy evaluation](./2022-10-21t17-23-28z.md)
and [policy improvement](./2022-10-21t17-34-21z.md) processes so to obtain an
optimal policy. The two processes in a sense are both competing and cooperating
in finding a better description of their objectives.

GPI is at the core of many [RL](./2022-10-20t15-15-55z.md) algorithms.
