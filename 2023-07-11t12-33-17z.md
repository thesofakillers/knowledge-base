In the default implementation of [GCBC](./2023-07-11t10-17-09z), the goal
representation is computed once using the starting state and then used for all
other steps that the policy takes. This is in part because when using
[CLIPT](./2023-07-10t16-36-37z.md), the textual encoder is independent of state,
and therefore it is only possible to produce one textual trajectory
representation per annotation. It would therefore be counterproductive to our
"bridge" to train GCBC on rolling visual trajectories but evaluate on static
textual trajectories.

With [CCLIPT](./2023-07-11t11-38-00z.md), the textual trajectory representation
is contextualized by the current state, so we can now implement rolling
trajectories both at training and test time: at each time step, a new trajectory
representation can be computed based on the current state, regardless of the
trajectory modality.

This may reduce the
[inclination of the model to rely on the start state](./2023-07-11t12-12-49z.md)
when learning how to act.
