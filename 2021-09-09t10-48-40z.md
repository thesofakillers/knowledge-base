Tom Mitchell, _Machine Learning_, 1997:

> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some
> class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T,
> as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Central to the notion of machine learning is the concept of _experience_, which
in most cases is simply the _data_ we feed into a model.

The kinds of tasks, performance measure and available experience allow us to
break down Machine Learning into different kinds.

In machine learning, the goal is to achieve good _generalization_.
