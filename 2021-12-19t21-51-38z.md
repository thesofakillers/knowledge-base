The softmax is a vector-valued [activation function](./2021-04-26t15-11-38z.md)
used for mapping an input vector to a vector whose elements sum to 1, similar to
a probability distribution, where each element represents a class.

Mathematically:

$$
h(x_i) = \frac{\exp(x_i)}{\sum_j\exp(x_j)}
$$

For large vectors, this exponentiated summation can become problematic
computationally speaking. We often circumvent this issue with the
[LogSumExp trick](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/02/09/log-sum-exp/).
