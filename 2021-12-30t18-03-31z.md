[Convolution](./2021-12-21t22-11-22z.md) provides a series of properties that
can be useful in certain settings.

First of all, convolution provides a means for working with inputs of variable
size.

Secondly, convolution allows for _parameter sharing_. When using convolution, we
can use the same parameter for more than one function in a model. For instance,
in a traditional [neural network](./2021-04-26t18-14-48z.md), each learned
parameter is learned exactly once when computing the output of a layer.
Conversely, with convolution each member of the kernel is used for every single
member of the input. This means that we only learn one set of parameters,
rendering convolution dramatically more efficient than dense matrix
multiplication.

Parameter sharing has the direct consequence of convolution to have an
additional property known as _translational equivariance_. Because of the weight
sharing, convolution will be [equivariant](./2021-12-30t18-21-46z.md) to any
translating function.
