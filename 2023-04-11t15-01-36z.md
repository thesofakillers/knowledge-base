Language-informed [sequential decision making](./2023-04-11t15-08-41z.md)
(LISDM) is part of what my [MSc thesis](./2023-07-10t14-32-02z.md) in
[AI](./2020-09-04t14-39-00z.md) examines. LISDM is concerned with the
development of algorithms that can leverage natural language inputs
(instructions, descriptions, constraints, etc.) to make sequential decisions in
a given environment relevant to some end.
