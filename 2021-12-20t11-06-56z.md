In [NLP](./2021-12-20t10-52-27z.md), a language model is a statistical model
that assigns probabilities to words and/or sentences.

Language Models are typically framed with the task of predicting the next word
given a history or "context" of previous words.

Language Models can also be used to directly assign a probability to a given
sequence of words, so that more syntactically correct or coherent sentences
achieve higher probabilities.
