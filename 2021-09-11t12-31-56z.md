For a given function $f$ whose inputs $x$ follow the
[probability distribution](./2021-09-10t19-20-02z.md) $p(x)$, the variance
describes the variability in the function around its
[expectation](./2021-09-11t12-11-20z.md).

Mathematically, this can be expressed as

$$
\textrm{var}[f] = \mathbb{E}[f(x)^2] - \mathbb{E}[f(x)]^2.
$$

This can also be applied directly to the
[random variable](./2021-09-10t19-20-02z.md) $x$:

$$
\textrm{var}[x] = \mathbb{E}[x^2] - \mathbb{E}[x]^2.
$$

For two random variables, we can then consider the
[covariance](./2020-09-28t14-45-37z.md).
