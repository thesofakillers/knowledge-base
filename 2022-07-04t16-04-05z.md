title: The Exact Match Metric

_Exact Match (EM)_, also known as _subset accuracy_, is an evaluation metric
used in the context of generative [language models](./2021-12-20t11-06-56z.md).
The metric measures the percentage of predictions that exactly match any one of
their respective ground-truth labels, ignoring punctuation and casing.

A code expression may help:

```python
def compute_exact_match(prediction, truth):
    return int(normalize_text(prediction) == normalize_text(truth))

em_score = max((compute_exact_match(prediction, answer)) for answer in gold_answers)
```

The strict nature of the metric makes it suitable for tasks with short and
limited outputs.

For similar reasons, for tasks where each prediction has exactly one possible
ground-truth, averaging EM across predictions is equivalent to computing
accuracy.
