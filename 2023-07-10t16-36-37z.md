CLIPT is a modification of [CLIP](./2023-04-17t11-14-27z.md) to work with
trajectories: sequences of images defined by a starting and end state that can
be described via text.

In it's most basic form, the modification does the following:

1. Encodes the start and end state of the trajectory using CLIP's visual
   encoder, resulting in embeddings $v_s$ and $v_e$ of dimension $D$ each.
2. The embeddings are concatenated into $v_c$ of dimension $2D$.
3. $v_c$ is passed through a MLP head which outputs the equivalent trajectory
   embedding $v_t$ of dimension D.
4. Only the MLP head is fine-tuned (the rest of CLIP is kept frozen) using
   contrastive loss with the paired textual descriptions of text (which are
   encoded into $v_l$ by the textual encoder of CLIP before contrastive loss
   calculations).
