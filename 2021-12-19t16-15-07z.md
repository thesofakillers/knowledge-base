In [NLP](./2021-12-20t10-52-27z.md), stemming is the process of mapping a given
word to its "canonical" form, i.e. from [stem + affix(es)] to [stem]. In
stemming, the approach is typically to to naively remove the affixes.

An example of stemming would be mapping "dogs" to "dog".

For a quick review on stems and affixes, see
