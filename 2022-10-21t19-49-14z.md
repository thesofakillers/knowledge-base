Learning in [RL](./2022-10-20t15-15-55z.md) generally relies on two main tasks:

- _prediction_: The task of estimating the [value](./2022-10-21t10-45-34z.md) of
  a state or state-action pair.
- _control_: The task of approximating an [optimal](./2022-10-21t12-52-19z.md)
  [policy](./2022-10-21t10-19-39z.md).
