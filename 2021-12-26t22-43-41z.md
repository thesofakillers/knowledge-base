In [deep learning](./2021-04-26t18-14-48z.md), co-adaptation refers to the
phenomenon in which several hidden units in a neural network have
highly-correlated behaviour.

This is problematic because for any set of highly-correlated neurons, all but
one of neurons are redundant. The redundancy not only limits network capacity
but also reinforces certain activations, causing the network to overfit.
