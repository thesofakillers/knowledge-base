In [Linguistics](./2021-12-20t10-50-39z.md), morphology is the study of word
formation. In morphology, we refer to the minimal information carrying unit as a
**morpheme**, such that a word will be formed by one or more morphemes.

We have different kinds of morphemes:

- **stems**: morphemes that can occur independently
- **affixes**: morphemes that appear in conjunction with other morphemes
  - **suffix**: after the stem
  - **prefix**: before the stem
  - **infix**: inside the stem
  - **circumfix**: around the stem
