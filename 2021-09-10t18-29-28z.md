Consider the two [random variables](./2021-09-09t11-46-21z.md) $X$ and $Y$ and
recall the [symmetric property](./2021-09-10t18-26-44z.md) of
[joint probabilities](./2021-09-09t19-46-09z.md):

$$
p(X, Y) = p(Y, X).
$$

Given the [product rule](./2021-09-10t17-47-05z.md), we can rewrite each side in
terms of conditional and marginal probabilities:

$$
p(Y|X)p(X) = p(X|Y)p(Y)
$$

Dividing by $p(X)$ we obtain the formula for $p(Y|X)$, also known as Bayes'
theorem:

$$
p(Y|X) = \frac{p(X|Y)p(Y)}{p(X)}.
$$

This can be expressed entirely in terms of the numerator by applying the
[sum rule](./2021-09-10t17-07-49z.md) and product rule to the denominator:

$$
\begin{align}
p(Y|X)  &= \frac{p(X|Y)p(Y)}{\sum_Y{P(X,Y)}} \\
        &= \frac{p(X|Y)p(Y)}{\sum_Y{P(X|Y)p(Y)}}.
\end{align}
$$

We see that the denominator acts as a normalization term to ensure that the left
hand side equals 1.
