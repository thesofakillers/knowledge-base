The convolution operation is an operation on two functions of a real-valued
argument. Mathematically, convolution is any operation for which the following
integral is defined:

$$
s(t) = (x * w)(t) = \int{x(a) w(t - a) da}
$$

Where $x(t)$ and $w(t)$ are the two functions being considered, respectively
referred to as the input and the kernel. We have also introduced the $*$
operator to represent convolution.

In practice, convolution is often applied in discrete settings. Here, we define
the operation using a summation rather than an integral:

$$
s(t) = \sum^\infty_{a=-\infty}{x(a)w(t-a)}
$$

Extending our definition to an even more practical setting, we can implement our
infinite summation as a summation over a finite number of elements since in the
context in which convolution is used, our variables are typically stored in
(multidimensional) (finite) arrays. For example, for an $M \times N$ image $I$
we define a 2D kernel $K$ and write

$$
S(i, j) = (I * K)(i, j) = \sum_m \sum_n I(m, n)K(i-m, j-n).
$$

Convolution is commutative, meaning that the order does not matter and we can
equivalently write

$$
S(i, j) = (K * I)(i, j) = \sum_m \sum_n I(i-m, j-n)K(m, n).
$$
