For any [language generation](./2021-12-19t18-09-02z.md) task, we can generally
say that any combination of the following subtasks are performed:

- **content selection**: what information do we want to convey?
- **discourse structuring**: in what order do we want to convey it?
- **aggregation**: split information in sentence-sized chunks
- **referring expression generation**: decide whether to use pronouns, which
  modifiers to use, etc.
- **lexical choice**: which lexical items, i.e. which words to use.
- **realisation**: the actual generation mapping from representation to string
- **fluency ranking**: discriminate between semantically/grammatically valid
  outputs by choosing the most fluent.
