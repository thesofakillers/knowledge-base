Summarisation is the process of generating a brief summary of a given input
text.

We can have

- single-document summarisation
- multi-document summarisation

We can also distinguish between

- generic summarisation
- query-focused summarisation

Finally we can also distinguish between

- extractive summarisation
- abstractive summarisation
