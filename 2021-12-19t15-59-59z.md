In the field of [linguistics](./2021-12-20t10-50-39z.md), the types of ambiguity
that appear in text are not well-defined. Some sources omit some kinds, other
sources omit other kinds, other sources group certain kinds together, et cetera.

In the 2021 NLP-1 course at the University of Amsterdam, we characterise
linguistic ambiguity in the following way:

Ambiguities can arise in two ways:

- When an **individual unit is ambiguous** on its own:
  - **[Morpheme](./2021-12-19t15-59-10z.md) ambiguity**, where a particular
    morpheme causes the resulting word to be ambiguous
    - e.g.: dog[noun] + s[plural] vs dog[verb] + s[3rd person singular]
  - **structural ambiguity**: when the same word can have multiple underlying
    structures
    - e.g.: unionise: the word "unionise" can be analysed as (un- (ion -ise))
      and as (union -ise).
      - Note: In both analyses, the morpheme "-ise" has the same function; it is
        not ambiguous by itself
- When the **way individual units are combined** is ambiguous:
  - **lexical ambiguity**: when an ambiguous unit (a word with multiple possible
    senses) causes the sentence to be ambiguous
    - e.g.: "the coach is arriving" - "coach" is ambiguous
  - **syntactic ambiguity**: This is a generalisation of structural ambiguity to
    combinations of words.
    - e.g.: "I saw a man with a telescope" has two different readings according
      to which syntactic structure underlies its surface form: (I saw (a man
      (with a telescope))) vs ((I saw (a man)) (with a telescope)). None of the
      words is ambiguous in isolation.
      - except maybe "saw" -- sometimes we can have both syntactic and lexical
        ambiguity in the same sentence.
