Often a [CFG](./2021-12-19t16-20-34z.md) will lead to
[ambiguities](./2021-12-19t15-59-59z.md) as several parse trees can be produced
from the same sentence. In other words, a CFG can sometimes parse a given
sentence in more than one way.

To address this, Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) associate a
probability to each [production rule](./2021-12-20t15-57-20z.md). In this way,
the probability of a parse tree can be computed. We then disambiguate by
choosing whichever parse tree has the highest probability.

The probabilities can be inferred along with the grammar via a dataset of
sentences annotated with parse trees, known as a Treebank. For a given rule
$X
\rightarrow a$, we can calculate its probability by counting:

$$
P(X \rightarrow a) = \frac{C(X \rightarrow a)}{C(X)}
$$
