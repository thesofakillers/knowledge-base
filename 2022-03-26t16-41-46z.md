In [information retrieval](./2022-03-26t12-31-28z.md), depth-k pooling is a
technique for obtaining a good range of ground-truth relevance labels for
[offline evaluation](./2022-03-26t15-44-21z.md). The process consists in the
following

1. We consider multiple retrieval systems
2. From each system, we consider the top-k results
3. We merge the results by removing duplicates
4. We present the resulting documents to the judges randomly.
5. The assessments from the judges are then collated into a single ground-truth
   relevance score per document using [Cohen's kappa](./2022-03-26t16-47-40z.md)

For each query, this will produce a large number of judgements, but it is still
incomplete.
