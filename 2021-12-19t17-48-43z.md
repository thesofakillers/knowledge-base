Discourse parsing in [NLP](./2021-12-20t10-52-27z.md) is the process of
automatically performing [discourse interpretation](./2021-12-20t21-47-13z.md)
via computer algorithms.

In general, we can either

- use hand-engineered features, such as the factors identified in the
  [discourse interpretation](./2021-12-20t21-47-13z.md) note.
- use neural models
  - taking two sentences an input
  - training an encoder
  - predicting the relation between the sentences
