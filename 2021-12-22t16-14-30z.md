As the name implies, self-attention GANs are a class of
[GANs](./2021-12-22t11-42-44z.md) that make use of self-attention. In
particular, the Generator can use self-attention to attend over long-range
dependencies and use cues from all feature locations when generating its output.

Likewise, the discriminator can discriminator can check that highly detailed
features in distant portions of the image are consistent with each other.
