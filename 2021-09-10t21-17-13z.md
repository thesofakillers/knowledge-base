For a [continuous random variable](./2021-09-10t19-20-02z.md) $x$, the
probability that $x$ lies in the interval $(-\infty, z)$ is given by the
_cumulative distribution function_ $P(z)$:

$$
P(z) = \int_{-\infty}^{z}p(x)dx.
$$

The derivative of a given cumulative distribution function will be equivalent
to the probability density function:

$$
P'(x) = p(x)
$$
