The principle of compositionality states that the meaning of a phrase can be
derived from the meaning of its parts.

This principle defines the field of compositional semantics in
[linguistics](./2021-12-20t10-50-39z.md).

Composition needs to be done in a distributional space because we can have an
infinite amount of sentences given a limited vocabulary, which prevents us from
working directly with the sentences/phrases.
