Conditional GANs are a class of [GANs](./2021-12-22t11-42-44z.md) where we can
specify details about the desire output (read: condition) by providing the
Network with an additional conditioning input, for instance a caption.

In training, both the generator and the discriminator need to be provided with
the conditioning input, so that the discriminator knows to recognize incorrect
generations if the conditioning request is not respected by the generator.
