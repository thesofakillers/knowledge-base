The gradient of a scalar-valued differentiable function $f$ is the vector field
$\nabla f$ whose value at point $\mathbf{p}$ is a vector whose components are
each of $f$'s partial derivatives at $p$.

$$
\nabla f(p)={
  \begin{bmatrix}
    {\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{1}}}(p)  \\
    \vdots                                  \\
    {\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n}}}(p)
  \end{bmatrix}
}
$$

The gradient of $f$ at $\mathbf{p}$ points in the direction of steepest ascent,
i.e. the direction in the vector field where $f$ is closest to its maximum
value.
