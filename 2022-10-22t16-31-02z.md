Ordinary [importance sampling](./2022-10-22t13-16-08z.md) obtains an estimate of
the expected returns under the target policy simply by scaling the returns
obtained under the behaviour policy by the importance sampling ratio and taking
the average.

The variance of ordinary importance sampling is unbounded. The estimate is
unbiased in the case of [first-visit MC](./2022-10-22t11-51-56z.md) and biased
in the case of every-visit MC.
