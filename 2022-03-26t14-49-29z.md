One-pass [inverted index](./2022-03-26t12-41-05z.md) construction consists in
going through the documents in our collection and building a partial inverted
index for the encountered terms until a memory limit is reached. At this point
the partial index is flushed to disk and cleared from memory, allowing us to
continue until the final document is read. We then complete the inverted index
construction by merging all the partial inverted index into a single one.
