[Convolutional Neural Networks](./2021-12-21t22-19-52z.md) have become the
standard for tackling visual data and visual tasks.

This is for a number of reasons. First of all, unlike fully-connected (FC)
[neural networks](./2021-04-26t18-14-48z.md), CNNs are able to extract local
features via the [local connectivity of convolution](./2021-12-30t18-03-31z.md).
This is of particular use for images where features are defined by
neighbourhoods of pixels rather than individual pixels themselves.

For similar reasons, CNNs provide an advantage over traditional NNs for
particularly large images. Here, the number of parameters we would have to learn
would quickly explode, causing difficulty in training or overfitting. The shared
parameters and sparse connectivity of convolution address this issue.

Finally, convolution combined with [pooling](./2021-12-30t18-27-26z.md) provide
the network with local translational invariance, which is a property often
expected for visual models.
