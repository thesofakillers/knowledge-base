Recall [joint probability](./2021-09-09t19-46-09z.md) and the variables $X$ and
$Y$ we defined.

Suppose we consider only sampling where $X$ is sampled to be $x_i$ and are then
interested in finding the probability that $Y$ is $y_j$. This is known as the
_conditional probability_ of $Y = y_j$ given $X = x_i$ and is written
$p(Y = y_j | X = x_i)$.

This will be given by the fraction of times that $X$ and $Y$ are sampled to be
$x_i$ and $y_j$ respectively, out of the number of times that $X$ is sampled to
be $x_i$ irrespective of $Y$'s value:

$$
p(Y = y_j | X = x_i) = \frac{n_{ij}}{c_i}.
$$

Recalling [marginal probability](./2021-09-10t17-07-49z.md), we can write $X$
and $Y$'s joint distribution as a product of the conditional probability of $Y$
given $X$ and the marginal probability of $X$:

$$
\begin{align}
P(X = x_i, Y = y_j) &= \frac{n_{ij}}{N} = \frac{n_{ij}}{c_i} \cdot \frac{c_i}{N}\\
                    &= p(Y = y_j | X = x_i)p(X = x_i).
\end{align}
$$

This is known as the _product rule of probability_:

$$
P(X, Y) = p(Y|X)p(X)
$$
