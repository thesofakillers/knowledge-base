When we have a collection of
[continuous random variables](./2021-09-10t19-20-02z.md) $x_1, \dots, x_D$, we
can define a _joint probability density_ by collecting the random variables into
a single vector $\mathbf{x}$ such that we have
$p(\mathbf{b}) = p(x_1, \dots,
x_D)$.

In this case, the probability is defined as falling in an infinitesimal _volume_
rather than in an infinitesimal interval and as such the integration is done
over a volume:

$$
\int p(\mathbf{x}) d\mathbf{x} = 1.
$$

Note the use of boldface to indicate that we are dealing with vectors, i.e.
multidimensional quantities.
