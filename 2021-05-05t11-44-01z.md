In [finance](./2021-05-05t10-22-45z.md), the Return on Investment (ROI) is an
estimated measure of the profitability of an investment by measuring the amount
of [return](./2021-05-05t11-45-44z.md) on the given investment relative to the
investment's cost.

This is typically calculated by dividing the investment's return by its cost,
hence producing a ratio.

$$
ROI = \frac{V-C}{C},
$$

where $V$ is the investment's current value, and $C$ is the investment's cost.
