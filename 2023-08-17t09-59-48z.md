1. Introduction
   1. Motivation and Problem Statement
   2. Contributions: figure out at the end
   3. Outline
2. Preliminaries/Background
   1. Sequential Decision Making
   2. Goal Misgeneralization
   3. Task specification
   4. Grounding: user intents need to be understood by executor
3. Method
   1. CBC
   2. use language-vision as interface: GCBC
   3. Talk about CLIPT
   4. talk about CCLIPT
4. Experiments
   1. CLIPT sanity checks
   2. Does it even work/realistic
      1. CALVIN dataset task
      2. task classifier?
      3. setup
      4. Results
      5. starting state stuff?
      6. clipt/cclipt checks
   3. Goal Misgeneralization
      1. BabyAI
      2. Setup 1
      3. Setup 2
      4. Occam's razor
      5. Post-game results
         - what should embs even look like
         - associative learning -> gmg?
5. Related Work
   1. Generative conditioned sequential decision making
   2. Language-informed sequential decision making
   3. Causal Confusion/Goal Misgeneralization
   4. Grounding
   5. Foundation Models

Goal misgeneralization is bad. we say it happens because the way task is
specified is bad. how can we improve task specification. we focus on goal
misgeneralization in the case of sequential decision making since it easier to
discuss in this setting.

ok but what is sequential decision making.

ok but what is goal misgeneralization.

How we formalize task specification.

Grounding: user intent needs to be understood by executor.

How do we do it specifically Talk about CBC we use language as the interface
Talk about CLIPT talk about CCLIPT

What do we do

First, check whether

1. works
2. gap Calvin dataset CLIPT/CCLIPT evaluations

Then, goal misgeneralization

1. babyai
2. setup 1
3. setup 2
4. occam's razor
5. post-game analysis
   - what should embeddings look like
   - associative learning -> gmg?
