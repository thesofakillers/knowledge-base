title: Why not Wide Neural Networks instead of Deep Neural Networks?

One will notice that [Neural Networks](./2021-04-26t18-14-48z.md) tend to be
deep rather than wide. Why is this?

Empirically, deeper networks have been shown to perform better. In particular,
the depth of a network appears to act as a
[regularizer](./2021-12-21t18-46-39z.md), increasing our model's generalization.

One possible explanation of this is that the use of
[several sequential layers](./2021-04-26t18-54-00z.md) encourages the model to
learn features at various levels of abstraction. This typically leads to better
generalization, as the model essentially has a better understanding of the
underlying domain.
