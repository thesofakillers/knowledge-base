The **distributional hypothesis** posits that the meaning of a given word is
defined by the way it is used and the [context](./2021-12-20t17-53-11z.md) it is
in. Words that are used and occur in the same contexts tend to purport similar
meanings.

A direct consequence of this is that word meanings can be represented in terms
of statistical distributions, i.e. vectors.

Since word-meanings here are inferred by usage, distributional semantics has the
downsides of being:

- not culturally invariant
- corpus-dependent
