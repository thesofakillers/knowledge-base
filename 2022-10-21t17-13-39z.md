When the dynamics $p(s', r | s, a)$ of an [MDP](./2022-10-21t12-12-18z.md) are
known, we can apply a series of methods from the area of _dynamic programming_
to find optimal policies for the MDP.

Dynamic programming generally refers to the idea of simplifying a complex
problem into many sub-problems and solving these recursively. Central to this is
the idea of _bootstrapping_, that is using previous estimates to make new
estimates. Bootstrapping is not limited to the dynamic programming context, and
is used in many other approaches to
[Reinforcement learning](./2022-10-20t15-15-55z.md).
