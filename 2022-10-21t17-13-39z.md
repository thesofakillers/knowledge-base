When the dynamics $p(s', r | s, a)$ of an [MDP](./2022-10-21t12-12-18z.md) are
known, we can apply a series of methods from the area of _dynamic programming_
to find optimal policies for the MDP.

Dynamic programming generally refers to the idea of simplifying a complex
problem into many sub-problems and solving these recursively. In this case using
dynamics-informed [bootstrapping](./2022-10-22t10-56-02z.md) to compute
estimates based on previous estimates.
