Weighted [importance sampling](./2022-10-22t13-16-08z.md) obtains ane stimate of
the expected returns under the target policy by taking a _weighted_ average of
the returns obtained under the behaviour policy:

$$
V(s) = \frac{\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}(s)} \rho_{t:T(t)-1} G_t}
            {\sum_{t \in \mathcal{T}(s)} \rho_{t:T(t)-1}}
$$

Weighted importance sampling is biased, although this bias converges to 0
asymptotically. The variance however is bounded, since the largest weight on any
single return is 1.
