Why can't we just use CLIP for the trajectory representations in the
[LISDM](./2023-04-11t15-01-36z.md) solution in my
[thesis](./2023-07-10t15-06-42z.md)? Why do we
[modify CLIP the way we do](./2023-07-10t16-36-37z.md)?

We see the modifications as necessary for two reasons:

1. The images of the environment are
   [out of distribution](./2023-07-10t17-17-47z.md) when compared to the
   distribution of images CLIP was trained on.
2. The visual component of CLIP encode a single an image. We
   [need to encode at least two to represent a trajectory](./2023-07-10t17-40-11z.md).

We address 1. by fine-tuning on images from our environment. We address 2. by
encoding multiple frames from our trajectory and combining them into a single
embedding using an MLP head.
