Causal confusion is the phenomenon by which a model learns the wrong
[[causal model]] for a predicted [variable](./2021-09-09t11-46-21z.md) $Y$, due
to [correlations](./2020-09-28t14-34-27z.md) between $Y$ and other variables $W$
that do not actually causally model $Y$. These correlations are referred to as
"spurious".
