A 2D line lends itself well to
[homogeneous coordinates](./2021-09-25t17-49-37z.md). A given 2D line in
homogeneous coordinates can be written as

$$
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{l}} = (a, b, c),
\end{equation}
$$

with corresponding line equation

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{x}} \cdot \tilde{\mathbf{l}} = ax + by + c = 0.
$$

From these definitions, we can then easily compute the intersection of two lines
with a cross product

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{x}} = \tilde{\mathbf{l}}_1 \times \tilde{\mathbf{l}}_2,
$$

and similarly for computing the line joining two points:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{l}} = \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_1 \times \tilde{\mathbf{x}}_2,
$$
