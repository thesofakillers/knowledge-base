The average precision $RR$ of a set of retrieved documents for a given query in
the context of [information retrieval](./2022-03-26t12-31-28z.md) is given by

$$
RR = \frac{\sum_{d \in rel}P@k}{\text{\# relevant items}},
$$

where we sum the [precision at k](./2022-03-26t17-29-22z.md) $P@k$ for the rank
$k$ of each relevant retrieved document $d$ and divide by the total number of
relevant documents in the system.

It is used for taking ranking into account when
[evaluating IR systems](./2022-03-26t15-04-29z.md).
