title: Why are ANNs arranged in Layers?

Apart from simplifying how we reason and think about them,
[ANNs](./2021-04-26t18-14-48z.md) are typically arranged in layers to aid the
underlying algorithms to reason about the problem in terms of sub-problems.

The hope is that by breaking down the network into sections (layers), each
section or subgroup of sections settles into tackling a particular sub-problem
whose solution can help the entire network in finding the right global solution.

For example, in image recognition tasks, it is often found that individual
convolutional layers approximate certain functions such as the
[sobel operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator) for example.
