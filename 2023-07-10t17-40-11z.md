We are interested in determining whether goals described in language will have
high similarity with the corresponding goal images and lower similarity with
non-goal images, for a variety of
[vision-language models](./2023-04-17t11-14-27z.md). We test this in
[clip-sanity-check.ipynb](https://github.com/thesofakillers/thesis/blob/main/notebooks/clip-sanity-check.ipynb),
visualizing the similarity matrices between language annotations and goal
images, trying a number of different prompts too. Ultimately, none of the
matrices show a nice diagonal as desired.
