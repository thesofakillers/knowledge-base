Market Capitalization, more commonly referred to as _Market Cap_ is the total
[dollar market value](./2021-05-05t10-07-48z.md) of a particular company. This
is calculated by multiplying the total number of outstanding
[shares](./2021-05-05t10-11-18z.md) of the company by the current market price
of a single share.

In other words, this is an estimate of how much a company is worth as determined
by the stock market.

Market Cap can also be used to describe an industry, rather than a single
company. In that case, the market cap refers to the combined market cap of each
company operating within that industry.
