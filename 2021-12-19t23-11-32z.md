Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) is an extension to
[SGD](./2021-12-19t22-34-39z.md) that combines
[RMSProp](./2021-12-19t23-11-04z.md) and [momentum](./2021-12-19t22-59-41z.md).
In other words, it

- computes an adaptive learning rate for each parameter
- keeps an exponentially decaying average of past gradients like momentum
- introduces bias corrections to the momentum estimates

Adam tends to prefer flat minima in the error surface.
