[Natural languages](./2021-12-20t10-50-39z.md) have been empirically found to
follow Zipf's Law: the frequency of a word in a given corpus is inversely
proportional to its frequency rank:

$$
f(w_r) = \frac{1}{r^\s},
$$

where $s$ is some empirically determined parameter, classically set to 1. This
makes Zipf's law an instance of a [power law](./2022-03-26t12-03-25z.md).

The $rth$ most frequent word has a frequency proportional to $1/r$. That is, the
most frequent word will occur twice as many times as the second most frequent
word, three times as the third most frequent word, and so on.
