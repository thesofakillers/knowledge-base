In [information retrieval](./2022-03-26t12-31-28z.md), semantic retrieval is the
process of retrieving documents given a query by representing our documents and
queries as vectors based on the semantic representations.

Here are a few options for semantic retrieval

- [LDA](./2022-03-29t20-26-31z.md)
- LSI: we use SVD to represent docs and queries in a low-rank semantic space and
  work with that.

- neural models
  - word embeddings: see [skip gram](./2021-12-19t17-34-57z.md)
  - BERT: transformers!
