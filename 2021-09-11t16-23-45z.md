In practice, when performing
[maximum likelihood estimation](./2021-09-11t15-54-04z.md), instead of directly
maximizing the likelihood function we maximize the _log_ of the likelihood
function.

We can do this because the logarithm is a monotonically increasing (i.e. never
decreasing) function, so the maximum of the logarithm of a function will
correspond to the maximum of the original function.

We _want_ to do this because this simplifies our analysis _and_ it circumvents
multiplication with summation thanks to logarithmic properties. Multiplication
is undesired because repeated multiplication of small probabilities can cause
numerical (computational) issues such as underflow.
