A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a kind of
[neural network](./2021-04-26t18-14-48z.md) that learns representations between
layers through the use of [convolution](./2021-12-21t22-11-22z.md) and
[pooling](./2021-12-30t18-27-26z.md) instead of the classical "fully-connected"
regression based on general matrix multiplication
($\mathbf{y} = \sigma(\mathbf{W} \mathbf{x}^T + \mathbf{b})$).

The use of convolution is motivated for grid-like data such as
[time-series](./2020-09-23t15-18-55z.md) (1-D grid) or more commonly,
[images](./2021-12-21t22-14-36z.md) (2-D and 3-D grids).

The neurons in CNNs are as such explicitly arranged in grids over which
grid-like parameters (convolutional kernels) are learned. For any given layer,
one or more convolutional filters are applied across the entire layer grid.

Importantly, we note that a direct consequence of the nature of convolution is
that the
[weights from a given filter are shared across the entire layer](./2021-12-30t18-03-31z.md).
This makes the operation incredibly efficient for grid-like data where there is
local-connectivity.
