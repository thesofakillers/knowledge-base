[Generalised policy iteration](./2022-10-21t19-05-11z.md) can be applied with
[monte carlo methods](./2022-10-22t10-38-24z.md) for the problem of
[control](./2022-10-21t19-49-14z.md) in RL.

In this case, due to the nature of MC methods, it makes sense to alternate
between evaluation and improvement on an episode-by-episode basis.
