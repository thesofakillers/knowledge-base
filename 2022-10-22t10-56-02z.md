_Bootstrapping_ refers to the technique of using previous estimates to make new
estimates.

In [Reinforcement learning](./2022-10-20t15-15-55z.md), bootstrapping is used in
[dynamic programming](./2022-10-21t17-13-39z.md),
[temporal difference learning](./2022-10-22t10-55-03z.md) and can be generalised
into the concept of _n-step bootstrapping_.
