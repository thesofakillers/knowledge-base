title: Symbol Grounding in Semantic Models

Symbol grounding is the process of ensuring that our semantic representations
are theoretically and cognitively valid.

This is a process that unimodal semantic models, such as language-only models
from [NLP](./2021-12-20t10-52-27z.md) struggle with.

This is because unimodal models follow a 'solipsistic' route to semantics,
where, in the case of linguistics, meaning is derived entirely by patters of
co-occurrence with other words.

Of course, semantics and language is more than word co-occurrence and has access
to context that is more present in other modalities, such as vision.

We know that a banana is yellow because we see it as such, not because we use
"banana" and "yellow" in co-occurrence often. This is an example of _visual
grounding_.
