To intrinsically evaluate the quality of the embeddings produced by
[CLIPT](./2023-07-10t16-36-37z.md), we do the following:

- Visualize similarity matrices where rows are textual trajectories and columns
  are the paired visual trajectories. We should see a diagonal: the similarity
  peaking for pairs.
- Calculate top-k accuracy for a trajectory. In other words for what percentage
  of the samples does the similarity load in the top $k$ values for correct
  pairs. The higher the score, the better.
- Plot the distribution of similarities within and across modalities, to check
  that these are somewhat aligned.

Example top-k accuracy for CLIPT

```plaintext
For the 256x256 matrix from 256 samples from the D test split:
Accuracy@1: 0.094
Accuracy@3: 0.211
Accuracy@5: 0.359
Accuracy@10: 0.605
Accuracy@20: 0.828
Accuracy@50: 0.953
```
