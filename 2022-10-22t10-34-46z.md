In practice, methods such as [policy iteration](./2022-10-21t18-51-34z.md) and
[value iteration](./2022-10-21t18-56-54z.md) from
[dynamic programming](./2022-10-21t17-13-39z.md) can rarely be applied, because
full knowledge of the [MDP](./2022-10-21t12-12-18z.md), including the dynamics,
is not known.

When the dynamics are not known, an alternative approach is learning the value
function from experience. This is known as value-based learning in the field of
[RL](./2022-10-20t15-15-55z.md)
