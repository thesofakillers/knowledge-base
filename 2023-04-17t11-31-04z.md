title: The use of "grounding" in ML

While generally tied to the
[symbol grounding problem](./2021-12-19t17-55-55z.md), the term "grounding" in
[machine learning](./2021-09-09t10-48-40z.md) is typically a bit more focused
and narrow, and tends to refer to the process of ensuring representations of the
same concept from different modalities are in similar semantic spaces.

You may "ground" representations from one language to representations of another
language. Similarly, you may "ground" representations in one modality (text) to
representations in another modality (vision). For instance, ensuring that the
vector for the word "apple" is similar to the vector of an image of an apple.

I have also seen the term "ground" used for the process of adapting image-level
representations to object-level representations, i.e. localization of objects to
enable bounding boxes. See for instance, GLIP [@zhang_glipv2_2022]. I am not
sure I agree with this latter use of the term "grounding".
