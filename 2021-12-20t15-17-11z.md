title: What is the difference between Lemmatization and Stemming?

[Stemming](./2021-12-19t16-15-07z.md) and
[lemmatization](./2021-12-19t16-15-45z.md) have the same goal: to process a word
such that the "canonical" form, the stem or lemma is returned.

The difference lies in the approach.

Stemming takes a more crude approach, naively chopping off any affixes, treating
a word independently of its context. This can include
[derivational](./2021-12-19t16-00-56z.md) affixes.

Lemmatization on the other hand takes a more rigorous approach, making use of a
vocabulary, [morphological analysis](./2021-12-19t15-59-10z.md) and context to
properly reduce the word to its "canonical" form, limiting itself to only remove
[inflectional](./2021-12-19t16-14-03z.md) affixes.
