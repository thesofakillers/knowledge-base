The exploration vs exploitation dilemma is one that often comes up in
[RL](./2022-10-20t15-15-55z.md).

To behave optimally, an RL agent needs to choose the action that maximizes its
future reward, the "greedy" action. It needs to "exploit". However, before
knowing that this action is indeed optimal, it needs to discover it via
exploration.

The exploration vs exploitation dilemma describes the issue of having to strike
a balance between the two approaches to be able to solve most RL problems
without failing.
