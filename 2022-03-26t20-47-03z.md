[When using language models for term-based retrieval](./2022-03-26t20-46-19z.md),
we can compare the language model for a query with that of a document use this
comparison for matching. Since language models are just probability
distributions, we can use [KL-Divergence](./2021-12-22t18-20-26z.md) for this.

For our query-document matching problem, we write:

$$
KL(M_d || M_q) = \sum_{t \in V} P(t | M_q) \log \frac{P(t|M_q)}{P(t|M_d)}.
$$
