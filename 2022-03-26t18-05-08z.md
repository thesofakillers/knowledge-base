Discounted Cumulative Gain is a metric used for evaluating
[information retrieval](./2022-03-26t12-31-28z.md) designed for accounting for
user behaviour.

The metric is made of two parts.

We first compute the cumulative gain $CG$ at a particular rank $p$, defined as

$$
CG_p = \sum^p_{i=1} 2^{rel_i} - 1,
$$

where $rel_i$ is the ground-truth relevance score of the result at position $i$.
This tells us the usefulness (gain) of the ranking to the user at this position.

Because users are more likely to be interested in results at the top of the
list, we the discount each term in the summation by their position in the
ranking. This gives us our discounted cumulative gain $DCG$ at $p$:

$$
DCG_p = \sum^p_{i=1}\frac{2^{rel_i} - 1}{\log_2(i + 1)}.
$$

Because search result lengths vary by query, we can normalize our metric
obtaining $NDCG_p$ by dividing $DCG_p$ by $IDCG_p$, the ideal discounted
cumulative gain, obtained by computing the $DCG_p$ of the sorted (from most
relevant to least relevant) ground-truth relevance labels.
