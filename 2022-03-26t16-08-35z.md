In practice, it is close to impossible to obtain ground-truth relevance scores
for every query-document pair of a [test collection](./2022-03-26t15-51-04z.md)
in [offline IR evaluation](./2022-03-26t15-44-21z.md). This is because of the
[nature of the IR problem](./2022-03-26t15-04-29z.md), where for any given
system we would have way too many documents to annotate.

As such, we resort to other techniques such as
[depth-k pooling](./2022-03-26t16-41-46z.md).
