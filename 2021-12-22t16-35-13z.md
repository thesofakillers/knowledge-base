In [statistics](./2020-09-14t14-24-41z.md), latent variable models are models
that define a distribution over observations $x$ by using some latent variable
$z$. The latent variable can be thought of as an explanation for the
observation.

In particular, we specify

- the prior distribution over the latent variable $p(z)$
- the likelihood connecting the latent variable to a given observation $p(x|z)$
- together, these define the joint distribution $p(x, z) = p(x|z)p(z)$ via the
  [product rule](./2021-09-10t17-47-05z.md)

So to ultimately recover

- the marginal likelihood $p(x)$ and the posterior distribution $p(z|x)$.
