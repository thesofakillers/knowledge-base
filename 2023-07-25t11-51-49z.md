Similarly to [this note](2023-07-13t22-55-21z.md), the following serves as a
quick and dirty [[knowledge dump]] for various numbers that may be useful for my
[MSc thesis](2023-07-10t14-32-02z.md).

## [[CALVIN]]

- When training ([C](2023-07-11t11-38-00z.md))[CLIPT](2023-07-10t16-36-37z.md),

  - Training split has 5124 samples
    - One sample is a sequence of frames with a length between 33 and 64 frames,
      on average 59.
    - In practice we take 2 frames (start and end) and train on those
  - Validation split has 1011 samples
    - The same sub-bullets for training apply here.

- When training [GCBC](2023-07-11t10-17-09z.md),
  - we train/val on the visual component of both the vision and language
    datasets
    - train split:
      - The vision split has 511581 samples
      - the lang split has 226934 samples
      - In total that's 738515 samples
    - val split
      - the vision split has 98958 samples
      - the lang split has 44399 samples
      - we only val on lang, so that's 44399 samples in total.
  - Each sample is a sequence of frames with a length between 28 and 32 frames
    roughly.
    - this is because they sample sub-sequences from 5124 recorded sequences to
      increase training size
