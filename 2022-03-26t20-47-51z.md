BM25 is an empirical method for scoring a document in terms of relevance to a
given query in [term-based retrieval](./2022-03-26t20-44-53z.md).

For a query $q$ and document $d$ from collection $C$, BM25 is given by

$$
BM25(q, D, C) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{idf}(q_i) \frac{f(q_i, D) \cdot (k_1
+ 1)}{f(q_i, D) + k_1 (1 - b + b \cdot \frac{|D|}{avedl})},
$$

where $k_1$, $b$ are free parameters, $avedl$ is the average document length in
the collection, and $f$ is the term frequency.

- when $k_1 \lim 0$, we have a summation of idfs.
- when $k_1 \lim \infty$, we have a summation of tf-idfs.
- when $b \lim 0$ we have no document length normalization
- when $b \lim 1$ document length has full effect
- when $f$ is large, ranking is based on idfs.

For long queries, we add a term $\frac{(k_3+1 ) f(q_i, Q)}{k_3 + f(q_i, Q)}$
