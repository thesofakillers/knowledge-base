title: Metrics for Evaluating IR systems

To quantify the performance of an IR system, we can use metrics used for other
systems such as [precision and recall](./2020-09-14t20-26-37z.md) for example.

However, these metrics have no notion of _rank_, and therefore generally fail to
address the [nature of the IR problem](./2022-03-26t15-04-29z.md) by not taking
the ranking of the items into account. For this,
[ranked metrics](./2022-03-26t17-02-12z.md) can be more appropriate.

While ranked metrics are an improvement, they do not take user search behaviour
into account. For this, we may decide to rely on
[user-oriented IR metrics](./2022-03-26t17-03-48z.md).
