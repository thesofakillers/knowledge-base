Cross-correlation is a measure of similarity between two series, X and Y, as a
function of the displacement between the two series. In the context of
[time-series](./2020-09-23t15-18-55z.md), this displacement would be a shift in
time of Y with respect to X, a lag (negative) or a boost (positive).

In general, any metric of similarity can be used, but
[pearson correlation](./2020-09-28t14-34-27z.md) is most common.
