An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a kind of computing system (computes
outputs based on inputs) inspired by the brain. In particular, an ANN is an
arrangement of [artificial neurons (units)](./2021-04-26t15-11-38z.md), with
each individual neuron potentially being connected to more than one other
neuron.

Typically, the units of an ANN are arranged in
[layers](./2021-04-26t18-54-00z.md) (not always, see
[GNNs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4700287)). The input vector
will form the first layer, and the output vector will form the final layer. In
between we have what are referred to as "hidden layers".

Very simply put, the [activations](./2021-04-26t15-11-38z.md) in one layer
affect the activations in the next layer, until we finally obtain the output
vector.
