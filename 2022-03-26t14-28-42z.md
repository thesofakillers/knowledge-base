Two-pass [inverted index](./2022-03-26t12-41-05z.md) construction consists in
the following two passes:

1. We sequentially read the documents from disk, and for each term that is
   extracted, we collect certain statistics, that are used to determine how much
   space the inverted list for that particular term will occupy in the resulting
   inverted index. Once this first pass is complete, the necessary space for the
   inverted index is pre-allocated on disk,
2. The pre-allocated space on disk essentially acts as an empty skeleton that is
   filled in the second pass, completing index construction without memory
   issues.
