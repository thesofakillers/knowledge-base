In [AI](./2020-09-04t14-39-00z.md), _goal misgeneralization_ is the observed
phenomenon in which a system successfully trained to pursue a particular goal
$A$ in setting $X$ fails to generalize to a new setting $Y$ and instead pursues
a different goal $B$.

The classic example is an [RL](./2022-10-20t15-15-55z.md) agent trained to
collect coins via rewards while navigating an environment. At training time, the
coins are always located in the bottom right of the environment. At test time,
the coins are located randomly throughout the environment. Goal
misgeneralization emerges if the agent capably navigates to the bottom right
instead of collecting the coins, as this location was spuriously correlated with
the rewards at training time.
