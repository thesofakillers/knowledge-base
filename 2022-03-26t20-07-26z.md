Rank-biased precision (RBP) is a metric used for evaluating
[information retrieval](./2022-03-26t12-31-28z.md) designed for accounting for
user behaviour.

The metric assumes a user model in which, for a given item in a list of results,
we have some probability $\theta$ of viewing the next item and some probability
$1- \theta$ of stopping.

With this user model, the metric tries to estimate the average utility of all
results:

$$
RBP = \frac{sum^N_{k=1}U@k}{E},
$$

where $U@k$ is the utility at rank $k$ and $E$ is the average number of examined
documents. We can compute these quantities with our user model. The average
number of examined items is simply the expectation of looking at $k$
($\theta^{k-1}$) and stopping at $k$:

$$
E = \sum^\infty_{k=1} k \cdot \theta^{k-1} \cdot (1-\theta),
$$

which for $\theta \le 1$ simplifies to

$$
E = \frac{1}{1 - \theta}.
$$

The utility at $k$ is instead the document at $k$'s relevance label $R_k$ scaled
by the probability of looking at $k$:

$$
U@k = \theta^{k-1} \cdot R_k.
$$

We can substitute these definitions above and obtain

$$
RBP = (1 - \theta) \cdot \sum_{k=1}^{N} \theta^{k-1} \cdot R_k
$$
