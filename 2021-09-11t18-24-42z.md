[MLE](./2021-09-11t15-54-04z.md) and [MAP](./2021-09-11t17-38-41z.md) are
frequentist approaches to making predictions about a given dataset $D$: in both
cases we had to make a choice for $\mathbf{w}$.

A [Bayesian](./2021-09-11t13-08-35z.md) approach to prediction would not dare
make a choice about $\mathbf{w}$, instead defining a predictive distribution by
marginalizing (applying sum rule) to our posterior. This allows us to compute
the entire distribution of $\mathbf{w}$ instead of a single optimal value.

$$
p(x'|D) = \int p(x', \mathbf{w} | D) d\mathbf{w} =
                       \int p(x'|\mathbf{w})p(\mathbf{w}|D)d\mathbf{w}
$$

This is essentially a weighted average of the product of all the predictive
distributions of $\mathbf{w}$ weighted by its posterior.
