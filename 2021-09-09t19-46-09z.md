Consider two [random variables](./2021-09-09t11-46-21z.md):

- $X$, which can take any of the values $x_i$ where $i = 1, \dots, M$
- and $Y$, which can take any of the values $y_j$ where $j =1, \dots, L$

The \_joint probability\_ then refers to the probability that $X$ will take the
value $x_i$ and $Y$ will take the value $y_j$ and is denoted
$p(X = x_i, Y = y_j)$.

In particular, the joint probability will be given by the number of occurrences
$n_{ij}$ in which $x_i$ and $y_j$ will be sampled for $X$ and $Y$ respectively
as a fraction of the total number of samples:

$$
p(X = x_i, Y = y_j) = \frac{n_{ij}}{N}.
$$

Here we are assuming that $N \to \infty$. Reasoning in terms of joint
probability brings us to the
