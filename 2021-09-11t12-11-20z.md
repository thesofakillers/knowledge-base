For a given function $f$ whose inputs $x$ follow the
[probability distribution](./2021-09-10t19-20-02z.md) $p(x)$, the average value
of $f(x)$ is referred to as the _expectation_ or _expected value_ of $f(x)$,
denoted by $\mathbb{E}[f]$.

For discrete distributions, this is given by

$$
\mathbb{E}[f] = \sum_x{p(x)f(x)},
$$

which for continuous variables is expressed in terms of an integration:

$$
\mathbb{E}[f] = \int{p(x)f(x)dx}.
$$

We see that what this is doing is weighting the average based on the relative
probabilities of each of the different values of $x$.

When sampling $N$ times, we can approximate the expected value as a finite sum
over these samples:

$$
\mathbb{E}[f] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum^{N}_{n=1}f(x_n).
$$

Expectations can also be of multivariate functions, in which case we can compute
the expectation with respect to each variable.

We also have _conditional expectation_, where we reason in terms of a
conditional distribution:

$$
\mathbb{E}_x[f(x)|y] = \sum_{x}p(x|y)f(x)
$$
