Precision and Recall at k (a.k.a. P@k and R@k) are modifications of the
[precision and recall](./2020-09-14t20-26-37z.md) metrics to account for the
rankings of the items, useful in the context of
[information retrieval](./2022-03-26t12-31-28z.md)

Mathematically, we have, for a rank $k$

$$
P@k = \frac{\text{\# relevant items at k}}{k}
$$

and

$$
R@k = \frac{\text{\# relevant items at k}}{\text{\# relevant items}}
$$
