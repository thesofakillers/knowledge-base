In [RL](./2022-10-20t15-15-55z.md), _action-value functions_, also known as _Q
functions_, are functions that define that value of taking action $a$ in state
$s$ under policy $\pi$. Very similarly to
[value functions](./2022-10-21t10-45-34z.md), they are defined as the
[expectation](./2021-09-11t12-11-20z.md) of the
[return](./2022-10-21t11-04-35z.md) from the given state when taking the given
action:

$$
q_\pi(s, a) \dot{=} \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ G_t | S_t = s, A_t = a\right].
$$
