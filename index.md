# Giulio Starace's personal Knowledge Base 

Welcome to my personal Knowledge Base. This site collects all my
knowledge-containing notes, following the Zettelkasten method. The site is
generated using Neuron, a static site generator designed specifically for
Zettelkasten note taking. I'm still getting accustomed with my ideal workflow
and with the philosophy of Zettelkasten so bare with me.
