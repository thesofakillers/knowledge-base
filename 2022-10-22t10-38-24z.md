Monte Carlo (MC) methods are a class of
[value-based learning](./2022-10-22t10-34-46z.md) that use averages of sampled
[returns](./2022-10-21t11-04-35z.md) to address the
[RL](./2022-10-20t15-15-55z.md) problem of
[prediction and control](./2022-10-21t19-49-14z.md)

To be able to have well-defined returns, MC methods act at an
[episode](./2022-10-21t11-26-04z.md)-level rather than at a more granular
step-level. That is, MC methods update values and policies only upon episode
completion, and in that sense are incremental in an episode-by-episode basis.

This is unlike [dynamic programming](./2022-10-21t17-13-39z.md),
[temporal difference learning](./2022-10-22t10-55-03z.md) and other methods
capable of [bootstrapping](./2022-10-22t10-56-02z.md) which can make updates
more than once per episode.
