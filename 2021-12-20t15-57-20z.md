In the context of [formal grammars](./2021-12-20t15-48-02z.md), terminal symbols
are the elementary symbols or units of the language defined by the grammar.

Nonterminal symbols are symbols that can be replaced by groups of terminal and
nonterminal symbols.

Production rules specify how to replace nonterminal symbols.
