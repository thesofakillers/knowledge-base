Here we simply modify our [SGD](./2021-12-19t22-34-39z.md) update formula with a
term simulating "momentum", using the gradient direction from previous
timestep(s). This basically discourages SGD from switching directions too
frequently or too drastically, dampening oscillations.

This generally achieves more robust gradients and faster convergence.
